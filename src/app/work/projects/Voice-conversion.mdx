## Overview

SonicFusion employs a combination of signal processing techniques and deep learning to 
generate any song in any voice. We first run the input song through an algorithm to separate 
it into vocals & music, and then feed those vocals into our trained model to output the vocals 
in the new voice. The separation is done based on the concept of repetition in music vs 
variation in human voices, and implemented using MATLAB. The 
isolated vocals are then sent into the so-vits-svc model that has been trained on a specific 
voice. This innovative approach holds promise for diverse applications, ranging from audio 
editing to immersive entertainment experiences.

## Key Features

- **Seperation**: One major difference between singing voice and music is that 
the music always has repeating period, whereas vocals have much less repeating period. 
Leveraging this fact, we derived an algorithm on MATLAB to attain the repeating period from 
a song and separate that from the mixture signal. Involves STFT, autocorrelation, etc.
- **Voice conversion**:  This involved collecting a 
comprehensive dataset of vocal recordings, running silence removal algorithms on it and 
utilizing it to train a neural network, enabling it to learn the nuances and characteristics of 
the voice with remarkable fidelity. We then 
synthesized the isolated vocals, generating a version of the song as if it were sung by the collected voice themselves. 

## Technologies Used

- **MATLAB**: For separation of vocals and background music, and silence removal for the 
dataset.
- **Python**: so-vits-svc model repo used the pytorch framework.
