## Overview

VisionGuard is a system that automatically navigates through CCTV cameras across locations, 
and aims to eliminate the need for manual scrutiny of extensive video recordings by 
employing cutting-edge technology to automate the navigation through CCTV camera feeds. 
Levaraging advanced artificial intelligence & computer vision algorithms, and given a license 
plate number along with last known location & time, the proposed system will meticulously 
analyse video streams or navigate through cameras in real-time to identify & follow the 
security threat as far as possible. 

## Key Features

- **Adaptable Navigation Algorithm**: It processes maps in the form of a matrix, or nested 
arrays, marking spots with cameras. The the rows & columns adjacent to the given location is checked, expanding the radius in each iteration. This 
algorithm was developed to be adaptable to any size of matrix.  
- **License Plate Detection**: The YOLO model was trained on custom annotated vehicle data.
- **OCR**: GCP's Vision API was used for accurate OCR of the license plate. 

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: For the desktop app interface.
- **Python**: Flask for back-end server.
- **Railway**: For deployment of the server. 
- **ESP32**: Cameras with MB connector boards are used to show the recordings & navigation.
