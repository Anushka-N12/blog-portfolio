## Lecture Summary

This week, we covered **UI testing** and **UML diagrams**. Here are some key takeaways:
- **Evaluation is an ongoing process:** Usability testing should be iterative and continuous.
- **Combine qualitative and quantitative methods:** Task performance data + user feedback = best insights.
- **Usability testing is adaptable:** Can be conducted in real-world scenarios even without a lab.
- **User-centered design is key:** Tailor the system to real user needs and behaviors.
- **System functions need to be communicated simply:** Use clear and intuitive designs.

### This Week's Progress

My previous proposal isn’t feasible due to implementation constraints, so I’ve been exploring new ideas. I’m looking into:
- **Reinforcement Learning Applications**
- **Swarm Robotics**
- **Multi-Agent Systems**
- Other interesting techniques and areas.

#### Cool Concept: Promoting Carpooling
- Found a fascinating concept: **[Rewarding High-Occupancy Vehicles with Dynamic Traffic Light Control](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/news/2024/06/using-ai-to-get-people-out-of-their-cars-and-into-hovs/)**.
- The experiment is simulated in **SUMO (Simulation for Urban Mobility)**, an open-source software.
- Reminded me of last year’s successful carpooling solution developed by our seniors, which benefited both carpoolers and private vehicle users.
- Also discovered **CityFlow**, a faster traffic simulator, as an alternative to SUMO.

#### Main Paper of Interest
- **Traffic Flow Optimization: A Reinforcement Learning Approach (2016)**  
  [Link to Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197616000038)
- Uses reinforcement learning to dynamically set speed limits for continuous traffic flow.
- Watched a related video: **[The Simple Solution to Traffic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHzzSao6ypE)**.

#### Data and Tools
- Explored **SUMO** and watched a tutorial: **[How to Create a Network and Simulation in SUMO Using OpenStreetMap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZycufsTEGU).
- Checked **Bayanat**, the UAE’s open data website, but found mostly accident data. Needed traffic flow data, which wasn’t available.
- Found a paid data distributor: **[Tomo](https://www.tomtom.com/traffic-index/dubai-traffic/)**.
- Discovered an implementation of a similar concept: **[Soft Actor-Critic for Variable Speed Limit Control](https://github.com/juanwulu/sac_vsl?tab=readme-ov-file)**.

#### Next Steps
- Dive deeper into reinforcement learning techniques.
- Start collecting data if my supervisor approves.
- Scheduled a meeting with my supervisor to discuss the new direction.

#### Other Resources Explored:
- **[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Review of Challenges and Applications](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/11/4948)**, 2021
- **[Geospatial Data in Transportation & Route Planning UAE](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/transportation/geospatial-data-in-transportation)**
- **[What are the top urban planning software tools for simulating traffic flow in cities?](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-top-urban-planning-software-tools-simulating-0nenc)**
- **[20 Ways AI is Advancing Carpooling and Ridesharing Optimization](https://yenra.com/ai20/carpooling-and-ridesharing-optimization/)**
- **[Estimating emissions reductions with carpooling and vehicle dispatching in ridesourcing mobility](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44333-024-00015-3)**, 2024
