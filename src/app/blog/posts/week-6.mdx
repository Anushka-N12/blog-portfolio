This week we covered UI testing, and UML diagrams.

Usability testing is an essential part of user-centered design, ensuring that a product is both functional and user-friendly. 
The goal is to assess whether users can efficiently and effectively complete tasks while interacting with a system.

Key Methods of Evaluation:
Usability Testing – Observing users as they interact with a system.
Experiments – Controlled studies to compare different designs.
Usability Inspection – Expert reviews to identify potential usability issues.
Theory-Based Models – Using predictive models to estimate user performance.

Why, What, Where, and When of Usability Testing:
Why? To confirm that users can use the product effectively and that it provides a positive experience.
What? Testing can be done on simple prototypes, fully developed systems, or final versions.
Where? Testing can be conducted in a usability lab or real-world environments.
When? Throughout the design lifecycle to refine and enhance usability.

Formative vs. Summative Evaluation:
Formative Evaluation – Conducted during development to identify improvements.
Summative Evaluation – Performed on the final product to determine if it meets usability standards.

Key Questions to Answer in a Usability Test:
Can users complete tasks successfully?
How long does it take to complete tasks?
How many interactions (clicks, screens) are required per task?
How satisfied are users with the experience?
What changes could improve usability?

Steps to Conduct Usability Testing
Step 1. Define Objectives -
Ensuring users can complete key tasks with ease.
Identifying usability problems in navigation or interaction.
Checking if the system aligns with user needs.

Step 2. Setting Up the Test -
Select representative tasks that users typically perform.
Recruit test participants that match the target user group.
Conduct sessions where users perform tasks while being observed.
Collect and analyze data on difficulties, completion rates, and user feedback.

Step 3. Choosing a Testing Environment -
Usability Lab - Controlled environment with video recording and monitoring.
Field-Based Evaluation - Conducting tests in real-world settings, offering more natural insights.

Step 4. Selecting Participants -
Ensure the test subjects represent actual users.
Recommended sample size varies: 5 users (Jakob Nielsen) or 8-16 users (usability.gov).

Step 5. Data Collection Methods -
During Task:
Track task completion time.
Count errors per task.
Identify areas where users struggle.
After Task:
Use questionnaires (e.g., System Usability Scale, Likert scale).
Conduct interviews to gather qualitative insights.
Avoid leading questions like "What’s wrong with the system?" and instead ask about specific experiences.

Advanced Usability Testing Techniques:
Think-Aloud Protocol - Users verbalize their thoughts while completing tasks.
Eye-Tracking - Monitors where users focus their attention on the screen.
Experience Sampling - Diaries or logs where users note usability experiences over time.

UML Diagrams (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized graphical language used for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting software systems.
Why Use UML? Graphical notation is clearer than natural language and code, giving an overall idea without minor details or domain-specific language.
UML moves from fragmentation to standardization, making it easier for teams to communicate and design systems.

A Few Types of UML Diagrams:
Use Case Diagram - Models interactions between users (actors, e.g., human users, external systems) and the system. Captures user requirements and scenarios.
Class Diagram - Depicts classes and their relationships (e.g., inheritance, association, aggregation, composition).
Sequence Diagram - Shows how objects interact over time, focusing on the sequence of messages passed between objects. Includes 'Lifelinees' representing the life span of objects, messages between them, etc.
State Diagram - Shows the states an object goes through during its lifecycle in response to events.

##Key Takeaways

Evaluation is an ongoing process – Usability testing should be iterative and continuous.
Both qualitative and quantitative methods are valuable – Combine task performance data with user feedback for the best insights.
Usability testing is adaptable – Even without a lab, testing can be conducted in real-world scenarios.
User-centered design is key – The system should be tailored to real user needs and behaviors.
System functions need to be communicated in simple ways.
