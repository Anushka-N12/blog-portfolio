## This Week's Work

This week, we covered **UI testing** and **UML diagrams**. Here's a breakdown of what I learned and explored:

---

### Usability Testing

Usability testing is a critical part of **user-centered design**, ensuring that a product is both functional and user-friendly. The goal is to assess whether users can efficiently and effectively complete tasks while interacting with a system.

#### Key Methods of Evaluation:
- **Usability Testing:** Observing users as they interact with a system.
- **Experiments:** Controlled studies to compare different designs.
- **Usability Inspection:** Expert reviews to identify potential usability issues.
- **Theory-Based Models:** Using predictive models to estimate user performance.

#### Why, What, Where, and When of Usability Testing:
- **Why?** To confirm that users can use the product effectively and that it provides a positive experience.
- **What?** Testing can be done on prototypes, fully developed systems, or final versions.
- **Where?** In usability labs or real-world environments.
- **When?** Throughout the design lifecycle to refine and enhance usability.

#### Formative vs. Summative Evaluation:
- **Formative Evaluation:** Conducted during development to identify improvements.
- **Summative Evaluation:** Performed on the final product to determine if it meets usability standards.

#### Key Questions to Answer in a Usability Test:
- Can users complete tasks successfully?
- How long does it take to complete tasks?
- How many interactions (clicks, screens) are required per task?
- How satisfied are users with the experience?
- What changes could improve usability?

#### Steps to Conduct Usability Testing:
1. **Define Objectives:**
   - Ensure users can complete key tasks with ease.
   - Identify usability problems in navigation or interaction.
   - Check if the system aligns with user needs.

2. **Setting Up the Test:**
   - Select representative tasks.
   - Recruit test participants that match the target user group.
   - Conduct sessions where users perform tasks while being observed.
   - Collect and analyze data on difficulties, completion rates, and user feedback.

3. **Choosing a Testing Environment:**
   - **Usability Lab:** Controlled environment with video recording and monitoring.
   - **Field-Based Evaluation:** Conducting tests in real-world settings for natural insights.

4. **Selecting Participants:**
   - Ensure test subjects represent actual users.
   - Recommended sample size: 5 users (Jakob Nielsen) or 8-16 users (usability.gov).

5. **Data Collection Methods:**
   - **During Task:**
     - Track task completion time.
     - Count errors per task.
     - Identify areas where users struggle.
   - **After Task:**
     - Use questionnaires (e.g., System Usability Scale, Likert scale).
     - Conduct interviews for qualitative insights.
     - Avoid leading questions like "What’s wrong with the system?" and instead ask about specific experiences.

#### Advanced Usability Testing Techniques:
- **Think-Aloud Protocol:** Users verbalize their thoughts while completing tasks.
- **Eye-Tracking:** Monitors where users focus their attention on the screen.
- **Experience Sampling:** Diaries or logs where users note usability experiences over time.

### UML Diagrams

**UML (Unified Modeling Language)** is a standardized graphical language used for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting software systems.

#### Why Use UML?
- Graphical notation is clearer than natural language and code.
- Provides an overall idea without minor details or domain-specific language.
- Moves from fragmentation to standardization, making it easier for teams to communicate and design systems.

#### Types of UML Diagrams:
- **Use Case Diagram:** Models interactions between users (actors) and the system. Captures user requirements and scenarios.
- **Class Diagram:** Depicts classes and their relationships (e.g., inheritance, association, aggregation, composition).
- **Sequence Diagram:** Shows how objects interact over time, focusing on the sequence of messages passed between objects.
- **State Diagram:** Shows the states an object goes through during its lifecycle in response to events.

---

### Key Takeaways
- **Evaluation is an ongoing process:** Usability testing should be iterative and continuous.
- **Combine qualitative and quantitative methods:** Task performance data + user feedback = best insights.
- **Usability testing is adaptable:** Can be conducted in real-world scenarios even without a lab.
- **User-centered design is key:** Tailor the system to real user needs and behaviors.
- **System functions need to be communicated simply:** Use clear and intuitive designs.

### This Week's Progress

My previous proposal isn’t feasible due to implementation constraints, so I’ve been exploring new ideas. I’m looking into:
- **Reinforcement Learning Applications**
- **Swarm Robotics**
- **Multi-Agent Systems**
- Other interesting techniques and areas.

#### Cool Concept: Promoting Carpooling
- Found a fascinating concept: **[Rewarding High-Occupancy Vehicles with Dynamic Traffic Light Control](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/news/2024/06/using-ai-to-get-people-out-of-their-cars-and-into-hovs/)**.
- The experiment is simulated in **SUMO (Simulation for Urban Mobility)**, an open-source software.
- Reminded me of last year’s successful carpooling solution developed by our seniors, which benefited both carpoolers and private vehicle users.
- Also discovered **CityFlow**, a faster traffic simulator, as an alternative to SUMO.

#### Main Paper of Interest
- **Traffic Flow Optimization: A Reinforcement Learning Approach (2016)**  
  [Link to Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197616000038)
- Uses reinforcement learning to dynamically set speed limits for continuous traffic flow.
- Watched a related video: **[The Simple Solution to Traffic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHzzSao6ypE)**.

#### Data and Tools
- Explored **SUMO** and watched a tutorial: **[How to Create a Network and Simulation in SUMO Using OpenStreetMap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZycufsTEGU).
- Checked **Bayanat**, the UAE’s open data website, but found mostly accident data. Needed traffic flow data, which wasn’t available.
- Found a paid data distributor: **[Tomo](https://www.tomtom.com/traffic-index/dubai-traffic/)**.
- Discovered an implementation of a similar concept: **[Soft Actor-Critic for Variable Speed Limit Control](https://github.com/juanwulu/sac_vsl?tab=readme-ov-file)**.

#### Next Steps
- Dive deeper into reinforcement learning techniques.
- Start collecting data if my supervisor approves.
- Scheduled a meeting with my supervisor to discuss the new direction.

#### Other Resources Explored:
