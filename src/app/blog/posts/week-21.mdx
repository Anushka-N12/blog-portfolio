Not much action this week — having to make hospital visits lately, due to a situation in the family, and couldn’t make big pushes.

That said, I did get a few important things done:

## Debugging & Cleanup

Spent some time debugging minor issues in the environment. There were a few leftover inconsistencies (state construction, reward NaNs, unexpected action shapes) that I cleaned up.
Also added better print statements during training (like VSL values, reward, segment speeds), which helps keep an eye on what’s actually happening during runs.

## Revisiting Equations

Went back to the theory behind the RL models and refreshed the Bellman equation, Soft Q-functions, entropy tuning, and the CVaR idea from WCSAC. This was mostly for writing the report and making sure I could explain everything — not just code it blidnly from tutorials or repos. Might do a future post summarizing all of that cleanly.

## Verifying Components

Did some manual tests to verify things like:
- reward shaping is behaving as expected
- entropy and lambda values actually update in training

These checks are boring but necessary. Hoping they help smooth things out as I move into the final training + demo prep phase.

Not a flashy week, but an important one.
Back soon with model results and final tweaks!
