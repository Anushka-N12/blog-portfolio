This lecture focused on User Experience (UX) and Prototyping, emphasizing the importance of designing user-centered products and using prototyping techniques to bring ideas to life. 
Here's a summary of the key points:

User Experience (UX) focuses on understanding users' needs, values, abilities, and limitations while aligning with business goals. 
It aims to improve the quality of user interaction and perception of a product or service.
Key factors: Useful, Usable, Desirable, Findable, Accessible, and Credible design.

Prototyping involves creating early, scaled-down models or versions of a product to test concepts and gather feedback. It helps visualize ideas, communicate design intent, and validate concepts before full development.
Why Prototype? Saves time and money, and allows early feedback and iterative improvement ("Fail faster, succeed sooner").
Fidelity: Prototypes can range from low-fidelity (lo-fi) (simple, less detailed) to high-fidelity (hi-fi) (detailed, closer to the final product).

Prototyping Techniques:
1. Paper Prototyping - Sketches and storyboards for quick visualization.
2. Digital Click-Through Prototypes - Interactive UI mockups without coding.
3. Coded Prototypes - Functional prototypes using front-end/back-end code.
4. Rapid Prototyping - Quick physical models (e.g., 3D printing) for iterative design.
5. Virtual Prototyping - Simulating system behavior to minimize costs.

Some Testing & Feedback options mentioned:
Usability Testing - Evaluates functionality, usability, and user experience.
Expert Testing - Involves UX experts and domain specialists to provide feedback.
Importance of Feedback - Continuous feedback helps refine prototypes and improve the final product.

## Summary
Prototyping is essential for bringing ideas to life, testing concepts, and improving designs.
The choice of prototyping technique (lo-fi to hi-fi) depends on the project's goals, technology, and resources.
Tools and methods vary, from simple sketches to advanced simulations and coded prototypes.
Testing and feedback are critical for refining prototypes and ensuring the final product meets user needs.

## This week's work

Although medical applications of computer vision are impactful, I didn't feel like I had anything to add to it.
For most publically available datasets, more advanced solutions that what I've learnt to build have been made. 
I went through many papers for diseases like Alziemer's, different cancers, Parkinsons, etc.
