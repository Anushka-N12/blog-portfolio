## Lecture Summary: User Experience (UX) & Prototyping

This week’s lecture focused on **User Experience (UX)** and **Prototyping**, emphasizing the importance of designing user-centered products and using prototyping techniques to bring ideas to life. Here’s a summary of the key points:

---

### User Experience (UX)
- **Definition:** UX focuses on understanding users' needs, values, abilities, and limitations while aligning with business goals.
- **Goal:** Improve the quality of user interaction and perception of a product or service.
- **Key Factors:** Useful, Usable, Desirable, Findable, Accessible, and Credible design.

---

### Prototyping
- **Definition:** Creating early, scaled-down models or versions of a product to test concepts and gather feedback.
- **Why Prototype?**
  - Saves time and money.
  - Allows early feedback and iterative improvement ("Fail faster, succeed sooner").
- **Fidelity:** Prototypes can range from **low-fidelity (lo-fi)** (simple, less detailed) to **high-fidelity (hi-fi)** (detailed, closer to the final product).

---

### Prototyping Techniques
1. **Paper Prototyping:** Sketches and storyboards for quick visualization.
2. **Digital Click-Through Prototypes:** Interactive UI mockups without coding.
3. **Coded Prototypes:** Functional prototypes using front-end/back-end code.
4. **Rapid Prototyping:** Quick physical models (e.g., 3D printing) for iterative design.
5. **Virtual Prototyping:** Simulating system behavior to minimize costs.

---

### Testing & Feedback
- **Usability Testing:** Evaluates functionality, usability, and user experience.
- **Expert Testing:** Involves UX experts and domain specialists to provide feedback.
- **Importance of Feedback:** Continuous feedback helps refine prototypes and improve the final product.

---

### Key Takeaways from the Lecture
- **Prototyping is Essential:** It brings ideas to life, tests concepts, and improves designs.
- **Choose the Right Technique:** The choice of prototyping technique (lo-fi to hi-fi) depends on the project's goals, technology, and resources.
- **Tools and Methods Vary:** From simple sketches to advanced simulations and coded prototypes.
- **Testing and Feedback are Critical:** They ensure the final product meets user needs.

## This Week's Work: Wildlife Conservation Project

This week, I focused on finding an **impactful project idea** and narrowed it down to **wildlife conservation**, specifically **bee conservation**. Here’s what I explored:

---

### Why Bees?
- **Importance:** Bees are essential for maintaining life on Earth, particularly through pollination.
- **Conservation Challenge:** One conservation method involves physically relocating bees to areas with low populations, which requires knowledge of **bee subspecies distribution**.

---

### Proposed Solution: Bee Subspecies Monitoring System
- **Implementation:** A system to classify bee subspecies using images.
- **Preprocessing:** Techniques to efficiently process continuous frames from cameras.
- **Core Technology:** **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**.

---

### Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
- **Why SNNs?** 
  - Unlike traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which process data through the entire architecture, SNNs mimic the human brain by activating only specific neurons for a given task.
  - This reduces **compute power** and **energy consumption**, making SNNs ideal for **edge devices** like cameras that need to operate for long periods without frequent recharging.
- **Implementation Plan:** Use **neuromorphic hardware** (e.g., FPGA) to support SNNs.

---

### First-Cut Proposal
- I submitted a first-cut proposal for the project, titled **Spike**.
