This lecture focused on User Experience (UX) and Prototyping, emphasizing the importance of designing user-centered products and using prototyping techniques to bring ideas to life. 
Here's a summary of the key points:

User Experience (UX) focuses on understanding users' needs, values, abilities, and limitations while aligning with business goals. 
It aims to improve the quality of user interaction and perception of a product or service.
Key factors: Useful, Usable, Desirable, Findable, Accessible, and Credible design.

Prototyping involves creating early, scaled-down models or versions of a product to test concepts and gather feedback. It helps visualize ideas, communicate design intent, and validate concepts before full development.
Why Prototype? Saves time and money, and allows early feedback and iterative improvement ("Fail faster, succeed sooner").
Fidelity: Prototypes can range from low-fidelity (lo-fi) (simple, less detailed) to high-fidelity (hi-fi) (detailed, closer to the final product).

Prototyping Techniques:
1. Paper Prototyping - Sketches and storyboards for quick visualization.
2. Digital Click-Through Prototypes - Interactive UI mockups without coding.
3. Coded Prototypes - Functional prototypes using front-end/back-end code.
4. Rapid Prototyping - Quick physical models (e.g., 3D printing) for iterative design.
5. Virtual Prototyping - Simulating system behavior to minimize costs.

Some Testing & Feedback options mentioned:
* Usability Testing - Evaluates functionality, usability, and user experience.
* Expert Testing - Involves UX experts and domain specialists to provide feedback.
* Importance of Feedback - Continuous feedback helps refine prototypes and improve the final product.

## Key Takeaways

Prototyping is essential for bringing ideas to life, testing concepts, and improving designs.
The choice of prototyping technique (lo-fi to hi-fi) depends on the project's goals, technology, and resources.
Tools and methods vary, from simple sketches to advanced simulations and coded prototypes.
Testing and feedback are critical for refining prototypes and ensuring the final product meets user needs.

## This week's work

I started this week's search with an intention is the project being impactful. I narrowed down to wildlife conservation.
Among the different species, I found that bees in particular are essential is maintaining life on Earth.
One of the processes of conservation itself involved physically relocating bees to specific locations where their popolation is low.
This required the knowledge of how many of which subspecies of bees are in which location. This is where I could place a monitoring system.

The implementation would require classification of bee subspecies with images, which I have worked on before.
To add on to this, I intend to implement techniques in preprocessing to efficiently process continuous frames.
The main part of my proposal was the use of a class of neural networks called Spiking Neural Networks.
The more common Artificial NNs ran data thorugh the whole of its architecture to output a result. It has proved to be revolutionary in various areas, from computer vision to natural language processing.
But the boom of ANNs came with the demand for exponential compute power. In comparison, SNNs more closely modelled the human brain - our brains do not run data through every single neuron to output a result, only some parts of it depending on the task at hand.
Similarly, SNNs dynamically produces 'spikes' in its neurons, meaning only some computation in the architecture will take place for a given input. This would drastically reduce the compute power and electricity required for running them.
Is this use-case, edge devices with cameras need to be exposed to observe its environment for long amounts of time, and they cannot be recharged constantly, so this method was more suitable.6
I learnt about the concept, as well as the frameworks used to implement them. SNNs were usually supported by neuromorphic hardware, so I planned to implement the mechanisms onto an FPGA.

This is the first-cut proposal that I submitted - [Spike](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rlf51nyLFMphXvswXiHSH5fpzD1gSeEr/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=100640676487683067455&rtpof=true&sd=true).
