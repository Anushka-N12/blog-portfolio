## Key Takeaways from Lecture

1. **Balance test types** - Combine white-box and black-box approaches
2. **Plan early** - Start during requirements phase
3. **Document rigorously** - Maintain complete test records  
4. **Test realistically** - Simulate actual deployment environments
5. **Automate regression** - Crucial for maintaining quality

Testing remains one of the most critical phases of software development, directly impacting product quality and reliability.
