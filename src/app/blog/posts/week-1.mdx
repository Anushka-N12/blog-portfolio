This week, we were introduced to the module - Major Project and Professional Practice (PDE3823). It is designed to synthesize our prior learning and shape our professional trajectory through a 60-credit major project.
Over 12 weeks, we will work under the guidance of an assigned supervisor to develop a project of our chosen discipline based on our career aspirations, focusing on research, planning, management, and communication. 
The module culminates in a professionally presented project portfolio, which includes a technical report (60%), a presentation (25%), and a technical blog (15%) documenting progress.
The module is led by Dr. Fehmida Hussain, and supported by Mr. Roshan Renji. We were advised to meet weekly with our supervisor. 
The lecture/discussion also emphasized academic integrity, with strict policies against plagiarism, collusion, and unauthorized use of AI tools.
We were shown the process & timeline we should follow to build a successful project on time. 
In the lab session, we started looking for templates for our blogs. 

We had already been informed about our supervisors a week before, and I was assigned Ms. Geethu Joy, an excellent methematics professor who taught me for the past 2 years. The meeting went well & was very helpful in coming up with an idea that aligned with my goals.


## The vision

Over the last 2 years, I explored basic concepts of ML algorithms, and have implemented simple models from scratch, and have integrated pre-trained models & APIs as well. Now, I want to increase the complexity of the model I work on to enhance my skills in the process, and want to build a professional end-to-end pipeline around it. 

## How I came to my idea

research process to be added

## Looking Ahead

So the next steps are to discuss and finalise on an idea with my supervisor, and write a first-cut proposal that will provide clarity on the objectives, requirements, research process, etc. The final proposal is to be submitted by the end of week 2, and the development is to start after its approval.
This blog will also be graded to observe consistent progress. 

## Summary

Today's class gave us an idea of how the next 3 months is going to look like, and how we need to deal with the task at hand. The blog & first-cut proposal is due this weekend.
