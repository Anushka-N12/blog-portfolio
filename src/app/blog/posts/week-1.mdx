## Introduction to the Module

This week marked the beginning of the **Major Project and Professional Practice (PDE3823)** module. This 60-credit module is designed to synthesize our prior learning and shape our professional trajectory through a major project. Over the next 12 weeks, we will:
- Work under the guidance of an assigned supervisor.
- Develop a project based on our chosen discipline and career aspirations.
- Focus on **research, planning, management, and communication**.
- Deliver a professionally presented project portfolio, which includes:
  - A **technical report** (60% of the grade).
  - A **presentation** (25% of the grade).
  - A **technical blog** (15% of the grade) documenting progress.

The module is led by **Dr. Fehmida Hussain** and supported by **Mr. Roshan Renji**. We were advised to meet weekly with our supervisors to ensure steady progress.

### Key Points from the Lecture
- **Academic Integrity:** Strict policies against plagiarism, collusion, and unauthorized use of AI tools were emphasized.
- **Process & Timeline:** We were shown a detailed process and timeline to follow for building a successful project on time.
- **Lab Session:** We started looking for templates for our technical blogs.

---

### Supervisor Assignment
- I was assigned **Ms. Geethu Joy**, a mathematics professor who has taught me for the past two years.
- I had emailed her a few days prior, informing her that I would share a list of project ideas soon.

## The Vision

Over the past two years, I’ve explored basic concepts of **machine learning (ML) algorithms** and implemented simple models from scratch. I’ve also integrated pre-trained models and APIs. Now, I aim to:
- **Increase the complexity** of the models I work on.
- **Enhance my skills** in building professional, end-to-end ML pipelines.

## Looking Ahead

The next steps are:
1. **Discuss and Finalize an Idea:** Collaborate with my supervisor to finalize a project idea.
2. **Write a First-Cut Proposal:** Provide clarity on the objectives, requirements, and research process.
3. **Submit the Final Proposal:** Due by the end of Week 2.
4. **Start Development:** Begin work on the project after the proposal is approved.
5. **Maintain the Blog:** Regularly update this technical blog, which will be graded at the end of the semester.

## Summary

Today’s class provided a clear overview of what the next three months will look like and how to approach the tasks ahead. The **first-cut proposal** and **blog setup** are due this weekend.

## Follow-Up Work

I’ve started searching for a fresh idea that aligns with my skillset and career aspirations. Stay tuned for updates on the project idea and progress!
