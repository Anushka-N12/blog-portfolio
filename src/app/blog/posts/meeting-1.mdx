I was assigned Ms. Geethu Joy as the supervisor for my final year project, an excellent methematics professor who taught me for the past 2 years. 
I have previously discussed my studies in the field and recieved valuable advice from her, and am grateful for it once again today.  

## The Current State, & Challenges

If you google final year AI projects, alot of them seemed repetitive, and most involved imported pre-trained models and either using them directly, or just fine-tuning on custom data. I had done these multiple times already for the projects last year, so I was loooking for something more challenging. 
But when I tried to look at higher degree theses/dissertations, I found myself struggling to understand them due to them being highly complex. 

## Suggestions

Regarding the next step of complexity that moves my skills upwards but isn't too far-fetched, Ms. Geethu kindly gave me a direction to look into, that is also highly trending in the industry.
Regarding an idea as well, she suggested areas that are highly appreciated and are the need of the hour, that would also help me with my future endeavours. 
I also discussed a paper topic I had in mind, and she provided some resources to dig into it further, to access the quality of the topic & whether to proceed with working on it. 

## Looking Ahead

So the next steps are to discuss and finalise on an idea with my supervisor, and write a first-cut proposal that will provide clarity on the objectives, requirements, research process, etc. The final proposal is to be submitted by the end of week 2, and the development is to start after its approval.
This blog will also be graded to observe consistent progress. 

## Summary

Today's class gave us an idea of how the next 3 months is going to look like, and how we need to deal with the task at hand. The blog & first-cut proposal is due this weekend.
