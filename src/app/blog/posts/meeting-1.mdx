## Introduction

I was assigned **Ms. Geethu Joy** as my supervisor for the final year project. She is an excellent mathematics professor who has taught me for the past two years. I’ve previously discussed my studies in the field with her and received valuable advice, which I’m grateful for once again.

## The Current State & Challenges

When searching for **final-year AI projects**, I noticed that many ideas seemed repetitive. Most projects involved using pre-trained models directly or fine-tuning them on custom data—something I’ve already done multiple times in previous projects. I was looking for something more challenging.

However, when I tried to explore **higher-degree theses or dissertations**, I found them too complex to understand. This left me in a tricky spot: I wanted to take on a more advanced project but didn’t want to dive into something beyond my current skill level.

## Suggestions from Ms. Geethu

Ms. Geethu provided valuable guidance to help me navigate this challenge:

1. **Next Step in Complexity:**
   - She suggested exploring areas that are **highly trending in the industry** and would help me move to the next level of complexity without being too far-fetched.

2. **Idea Suggestions:**
   - She recommended focusing on areas that are **highly appreciated** and address current needs, which would also benefit my future career.

3. **Paper Topic Discussion:**
   - I shared a paper topic I had in mind, and she provided **resources** to dig deeper into it. This will help me assess the quality of the topic and decide whether to proceed with it.
