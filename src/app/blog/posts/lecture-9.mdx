## Software Testing Principles

Testing involves executing programs to find faults while balancing:
- **Verification:** Proving program correctness
- **Validation:** Finding errors in real environments  
- **Debugging:** Diagnosing and correcting errors

Key principle: Remove defects early since testing's quality improvement potential is limited.

## Types of Software Tests

| Test Type | Description | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|-------------|------|------|
| **Unit Testing** (White Box) | Tests individual components | High code coverage | Tester bias possible |
| **Integration Testing** | Combines modules | Catches interface issues | Complex to orchestrate |
| **Function Testing** (Black Box) | Tests against specifications | Unbiased by implementation | Limited test coverage |
| **Regression Testing** | Checks effects of changes | Maintains existing functionality | Test selection challenging |
| **System Test** | Full system evaluation | Real-world simulation | Resource intensive |
| **Acceptance Tests** | Client validation | Confirms business needs | Late-stage discovery |

---

### Testing Strategies

**Black-Box Testing:**
- Based on functional specs only
- Simulates real user behavior
- Also called functional testing

**White-Box Testing:**
- Requires internal structure knowledge
- Focuses on code paths
- Also called structural testing

---

## Integration Approaches

### Top-Down Testing
**Process:** 
1. Test control program first  
2. Integrate modules one-by-one

**Pros:**
- No test drivers needed
- Early interface error detection

**Cons:**
- Requires test stubs  
- Critical low-level errors found late

### Bottom-Up Testing  
**Process:**
1. Test low-level modules first
2. Build upward

**Pros:**
- No stubs needed
- Early critical module validation

**Cons:**
- Requires test drivers
- Late interface error discovery

## Test Planning Essentials

**When:** Starts during requirements phase  
**Key Elements:**
- Objectives for each phase
- Schedules and responsibilities  
- Resource availability
- Completion criteria

---

## Test Execution Best Practices

1. Treat testing as scientific experiments
2. Document all anomalous behavior  
3. Maintain test libraries (reports, incidents, plans)
4. For real-time systems:
   - Test for deadlocks/thrashing  
   - Simulate hardware faults
   - Stress test designs
   - Account for missing modules

## Key Takeaways

1. **Balance test types** - Combine white-box and black-box approaches
2. **Plan early** - Start during requirements phase
3. **Document rigorously** - Maintain complete test records  
4. **Test realistically** - Simulate actual deployment environments
5. **Automate regression** - Crucial for maintaining quality

Testing remains one of the most critical phases of software development, directly impacting product quality and reliability.
