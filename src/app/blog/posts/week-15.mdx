## The Missing Density Metric

The Vector Flow Tiles endpoint is where I wanted to get a density-like value from.
It's the value that makes roads look blue/yellow/red on maps, a percentage to show congestion/overhead on capacity.

- The endpoint returned **no outputs** for my coordinates
- This was problematic because even the simpler 2010 reference model used this metric

## The Provider Hunt

### Failed Attempts:
- **Google Maps**: Only offered JavaScript plugins for map apps, no direct data extraction

### The Azure Discovery:
Finally found **Azure Traffic APIs** - but the first test was rough, the output was absolute nonsense coordinates.

I understood that I has to be my calculations or formatting, 
since it is a trusted cloud service. After lots of trials, it turned out that -
TomTom had straightforward functions, to convert lat/long to x/y tile values, with reference to given zoom value.
But Azure was also influeenced by an 'extent' value, that changed the dimensions of the tile,
from the default 256x256 to 4096. This was for precision purposes. So when we got back x,y values,
they needed to be scaled down to 256 before converting from tile xy to lat/long again. 

## Resolution and Moving Forward

After working through these issues:
- I finally got the traffic density values I needed
- Verified all other endpoints (speeds, travel time, incidents) are working correctly
- Decided to stick with Azure for all data needs to maintain consistency
- Learned that sometimes you have to dig deep into documentation quirks

While this debugging process took some time, now I've got finally reliable data flowing through the pipeline.
