Final week! No new features or bugs (for once) – just sitting down to put everything into words.

### Documentation Week

I spent this week fleshing out the full dev documentation and report. Most of it was already floating around in code comments, scratch notes, or in my head — just not organized properly.

What got done:

-  **Environment Design**: Explained how the macroscopic MetaNet model works, what links and nodes represent, and how we modeled UAE roads in segments.
-  **State Construction**: Wrote out the logic behind each input state element (current/prev VSL, speeds, predictions, incident flag).
-  **Reward Structure**: Documented all reward variations we tried — from TTS to speed bonuses and transformations.
-  **SAC + WCSAC Logic**: Detailed all loss terms (actor, critic, safety critic, entropy, CVaR), when each kicks in, and how they interact.
-  **Training Loop**: Walked through the full loop — action choosing, reward aggregation every 30 steps, learning cycle, and evaluation.
-  **Experimental Notes**: Jotted down lessons from flat rewards, shape bugs, NaN debugging, and critic instability.
-  **Figures**: Captured key plots: learning curve, average segment speeds, and VSL decisions over time.

### The Writing Process

It’s funny — thinking about all the effort that went into designing each part made writing it way easier. The hard part wasn’t explaining… it was remembering everything we tried!

Also wrote some blog posts (this one included), cleaned up the README, and polished the portfolio entry.

### What’s Next?

Just pushing everything to GitHub, finalizing the presentation deck, and I’m DONE. Might revisit this in the future to build a dashboard or real-time demo — who knows?

But for now… we’re wrapped!
