No class this week due to Eid holidays.

## Update regarding deadline

The standard deadline was April 11th, that is the end of next week. But as you must've noticed so far, the project progress is not going how it should be.
I had personal reasons for this, but I waited this far to try and catch up. But now that there is little time and a lot of work, I decided to talk to the module & CEI department head Dr. Fehmida about it.
She has been aware of my situation, and had approved my gap year 2 years ago as well for the same reasons. I explained the current circumstances. 
She was very understanding, and advised me to go ahead and apply for a defferal. That would mean the deadline would be extended till mid-May.
I also discussed it with my supervisor, and submitted the application. I feel relieved about the extra time, and am thankful to them for the consideration.
