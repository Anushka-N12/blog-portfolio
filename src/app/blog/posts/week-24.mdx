This week, we finally brought in **Worst-Case Soft Actor-Critic (WCSAC)** and gave our agent some risk-awareness. ðŸš§

### What is WCSAC?

At a high level, it builds on regular SAC but adds:
- A separate **safety critic** that learns which actions could be risky.
- A **safety reward** signal based on deceleration events (sharp speed drops).
- A **CVaR-based loss** to make the agent focus more on bad outcomes (worst-case scenarios).
- A **lambda coefficient** that balances regular performance and safety, and is adjusted during training.

This lets the agent still aim for good performance, but **avoid risky decisions**.

###  Key Additions This Week

#### Safety Critic

We added a new Q-network (`Q_safety`) with its own optimizer. Itâ€™s trained just like a regular critic, but instead of using traffic efficiency rewards, it learns from a **safety reward** signal.

Snippet:

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact={false}
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: `q_safety_pred = self.ac.get_safety_q(tf.concat([states, actions], axis=1))
safety_loss = 0.5 * tf.reduce_mean((q_safety_pred - safety_rewards) ** 2)
`,
            label: 'train.py',
            language: 'python',
            showLineNumbers: true
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
    maxHeight="400px"
/>

### Safety Reward = Speed Drop
Our safety signal is simple but effective:
If the speed drops suddenly between two segments (say S2 to S3), we flag that as risky.
Based on that, we generate a reward of 1 (risky) or 0 (safe).

### Adaptive Lambda
We track how many risky actions the agent is taking and adapt lambda_safety accordingly:

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact={false}
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: `if too_many_unsafe_actions:
    lambda_safety += 0.01
else:
    lambda_safety -= 0.01
lambda_safety = np.clip(lambda_safety, 0.1, 10)`,
            label: 'train.py',
            language: 'python',
            showLineNumbers: true
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
    maxHeight="400px"
/>

We still need to tune thresholds and CVaR Î± a bit more, but the structure is working!
