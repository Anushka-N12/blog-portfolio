## Introduction

In this meeting, I discussed the shortcomings of my previous idea and proposed a new one that I found interesting. Ms. Geethu provided valuable feedback and guidance on how to make the project more unique and impactful.

---

## Feedback on Previous Idea

- **Bee Subspecies Detection Using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with FPGA:**
  - Ms. Geethu pointed out that FPGA implementation requires **extensive training and detailed study**.
  - She suggested exploring other options within the idea to enhance it, as FPGA might not be feasible within the project timeline.

## New Idea: Dynamic Speed Limits for Traffic Flow Optimization

I proposed a new idea focused on **maintaining traffic flow**, a problem I face daily during my commute to university. While **traffic light control** is a widely researched area, I came across a different approach: **dynamic speed limits at different points on a highway**. This approach involves **reinforcement learning**, an area I’m particularly interested in.

### Ms. Geethu’s Feedback on the New Idea
- **Acceptable Ideas:** She mentioned that either the bee subspecies detection or the traffic flow optimization idea could be accepted.
- **Adding Unique Contributions:** She emphasized the importance of **adding my own contribution** to existing solutions, not just by changing the data or application but by **improving the method itself**.
- **Focus on Optimization:** She highlighted that **optimization** is a critical area in AI, especially in an era where high compute power is often required. Improving algorithms can make the project more impactful and relevant.
- **Future Opportunities:** Ms. Geethu encouraged me to think beyond the module credits and consider how this project could benefit my future path, such as in **conferences, competitions, and research publications**.
- **Reassurance and Urgency:** She reassured me of my capabilities but urged me to **finalize the idea and start working on it as soon as possible**.

## Following Research

To ensure the project is genuinely innovative, I plan to:
- **Review Recent Papers:** Spend a little more time going through the most recent papers related to **optimizing the algorithms** used in my ideas.
- **Focus on Improvement:** Aim to **improve the implementation** rather than replicate existing solutions.

---

## Summary

This meeting was a turning point in finalizing my project idea. Key takeaways:
- **FPGA Limitations:** The previous idea involving FPGA implementation is not feasible due to the complexity and time required.
- **New Idea:** Dynamic speed limits for traffic flow optimization using reinforcement learning is a promising alternative.
- **Unique Contribution:** Focus on **optimizing algorithms** to add value to existing solutions.
- **Next Steps:** Review recent papers, finalize the idea, and start implementation.

---

## Key Takeaways
- **Feasibility Matters:** FPGA implementation is too complex for the current timeline.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** A promising area for traffic flow optimization.
- **Optimization is Key:** Improving algorithms is highly valuable and relevant in AI.
- **Future Focus:** Think beyond the module and consider how the project can benefit my career.
- **Urgency:** Finalize the idea and start working on it immediately.
