We discussed the shortcomings of the previous idea, and I proposed another idea I found interesting.
Regarding the bee subspecies detection using spiking neural networks with FPGA, she mentioned that the implementation with FPGA requires much more training & detailed study, 
and that I should find other options within the idea to enhance it. 
I proposed a solution to maintaining traffic flow, an issue I deal with daily during commute to university.
Traffic ligh control is a widely-known & worked on area, but I came across another appraoch - by suggesting dynamic speed limits at different points on a highway.
It involved reinforcement learning, an area that I am quite interested to work on. 
She said either of the 2 ideas can be accepted, but to add my own contribution to the existing solutions. 
Not just the data or specific applicaion, but she told me it is highly valuable to improve the method itself, 
an area known as optimisation which is the need of the hour in this era of AI that comes with need for high compute power. 
I am very thankful to her for thinking not just for the module credits but for my future path with this project in conferences, competitions, etc.
She also reassured me of my capabilities, while urging me to finalise and start working on it asap.

## Following Research

I want to take just a little more time going through the most recent papers related to optimising the algorithms used in the 
ideas I have, so the implementation can be genuinely improved, instead of replicated.
