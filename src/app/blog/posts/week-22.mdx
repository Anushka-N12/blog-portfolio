I had multiple goals for this week:
- Speed Prediction Model
- Dashboard Development
- Adding predictions & other inputs to state vector

# Building a Traffic Speed Predictor with Little Data
*How I hacked together a decent traffic speed model when I barely had any data*

---

## The Problem: Predicting Traffic with Almost No History

I had speed data from highway sensors - but only for **1-2 weeks**. Most ML tutorials assume you have months of clean data. Reality check: **real-world data is messy and limited**.

**My constraints:**
- Only 5-9 AM and 4-8 PM data (peak hours)
- Some responses randomly returned "Error" 
- Timestamps weren't perfectly aligned

---

## Models I Tried (Spoiler: KNN Won)

1. Time-Average
- I used this as a simple baseline — just averaged speeds based on the hour of day.
- It didn’t hold up when speeds changed minute by minute. Way too stiff for real-time prediction.

2. Last-Value
- The logic here was “what if we just repeat yesterday’s value at this time?”
- But it couldn’t capture short-term shifts or time-of-day effects. Ended up too lazy for anything dynamic.

3. Random Forest
- My usual go-to for tabular data since it handles non-linear stuff well.
- But with such a tiny dataset, it would overfit everything and not generalize at all.

4. KNN (Winner!)
- Looked at similar historical moments and used them to make predictions.
- Surprisingly solid! It just worked with the limited data I had and didn't need training.

## The Secret Sauce: Time Features That Don't Suck

Normal time features break at midnight (23:59 and 00:01 are "far apart"). Fixed it with:

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact={false}
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: `df['hour_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['hour']/24)
df['hour_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['hour']/24)`,
            label: 'train.py',
            language: 'python',
            showLineNumbers: true
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
    maxHeight="400px"
/>

## Why KNN Was the Dark Horse Winner
- No training needed - Just memorizes patterns (perfect for small data)
- Local thinking - Predicts based on most similar historical moments
- Handles uneven times - 8:03 prediction uses nearby 8:00 and 8:05 data
- Pro move: Used distance-weighted voting so closer times matter more.

### The "Good Enough" Results

-  Time-Average --> 5.78 
- Last-Value --> 14.47 
- Random Forest --> 10.17 
- KNN --> 7.88 

KNN did better if we take the average performance in multiple tests. 
Not perfect, but decent for a week of data!

## Dashboard

This was done in a jiffy! Plain HTML, CSS, JS. Integrated maps in a few lines, added model call in a few lines, done!
