Building on top of a project I did a few months ago, I proposed an app that utilizes an LLM for organisation purposes, with multiple features, focusing on both professional & personal goals.

## Feedback

Ms. Geethu made me realize that some of the features were repetitive & have been done many times before. 
But still, she suggesting organising the idea in a document for further discussion. 

## Next steps

Since I want to live up to the expectations of my supervisor who's known me for the past 4 years, I want to 
come up with someting more unique than this proposal, so I will continue looking for more different ones.
