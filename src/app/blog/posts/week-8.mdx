# Normalization and Debugging: Key Concepts and Strategies

Normalization: A set of rules that tables & databases must follow to be well-structured. 
It is historically presented as a sequence of normal forms.

### First Normal Form (1NF):
- The domain of each attribute contains only atomic values.
- Each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.

**Example:** In a library database, every column should contain single values.

### Functional Dependency
- **Functional Dependency (FD):** Y is functionally dependent on X if each set x in X corresponds to precisely one set y in Y.
- **Full Functional Dependency:** Y is fully functionally dependent on X if Y is not dependent on any proper subset of X.

**Example:** In a `Book` table, the `Author` attribute is functionally dependent on `{BookNo, Title}`.

### Problems with Non-Normalized Tables
- **Insertion Anomaly:** Cannot insert new data without related data.
- **Update Anomaly:** Must update multiple rows for a single change.
- **Deletion Anomaly:** Loss of information when deleting data.

### Armstrong Inference Rules (1974)
- **Axioms:** Reflexivity, Augmentation, Transitivity.
- **Derived Rules:** Union, Decomposition, Pseudotransitivity.

### Second Normal Form (2NF):
- It is in 1NF.
- No non-prime attribute is dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key.

**Example:** In a library, `Patron → PhoneNo` is a dependency that violates 2NF.

### Third Normal Form (3NF):
- It is in 2NF.
- All attributes are determined only by candidate keys, not by non-prime attributes.

**Example:** In a `BorrowedBooks` table, `Patron → Address` violates 3NF.

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
A stricter form of 3NF where every non-trivial dependency `X → Y` must have `X` as a superkey.

### Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
A table is in 4NF if:
- For every non-trivial multivalued dependency `X => Y`, `X` is a candidate key or a superset of a candidate key.

### Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
A table is in 5NF if every non-trivial join dependency is implied by its candidate keys.

### Lossless Decomposition
A decomposition is lossless if the original table can be recreated by joining the decomposed tables without losing information.

## Coding and Debugging

Debugging: The process of identifying and resolving errors (bugs) in software systems. Ensures software quality and performance; Enhances user satisfaction.

### Goals of Debugging
- Detect and fix bugs efficiently.
- Maintain software stability.

### Debugging Process
1. **Reproduce the Bug:** Recreate the conditions that caused the bug.
2. **Locate the Bug:** Find where the bug is in the code.
3. **Identify the Root Cause:** Understand why the bug happened.
4. **Fix the Bug:** Make necessary changes to the code.
5. **Test the Fix:** Run tests to ensure the bug is resolved.
6. **Document the Process:** Record the details of the bug and the fix.

### Debugging Approaches/Strategies
- **Brute Force:** Study the system for a longer duration.
- **Backtracking:** Trace the program backward from the failure point.
- **Forward Analysis:** Trace the program forward using breakpoints.
- **Cause Elimination:** Isolate potential causes using binary partitioning.
- **Static Analysis:** Analyze code without executing it.
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Execute code and analyze its behavior at runtime.
- **Collaborative Debugging:** Multiple developers work together to debug.
- **Logging and Tracing:** Use logs to identify the sequence of events.
- **Automated Debugging:** Use tools to assist in debugging.

### Common Errors During Debugging
- Syntax errors
- Logical errors
- Runtime errors
- Stack overflow
- Index Out of Bound Errors
- Infinite loops
- Concurrency Issues
- I/O errors

### Debugging Tools
1. **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):** Visual Studio, Eclipse, PyCharm.
2. **Standalone Debuggers:** GDB (GNU Debugger).
3. **Logging Utilities:** Log program states for analysis.
4. **Static Code Analyzers:** Examine code without execution.
5. **Dynamic Analysis Tools:** Monitor software at runtime.
6. **Performance Profilers:** Identify performance bottlenecks.

### Testing vs Debugging
- **Testing:** Identify problems before software is put to use.
- **Debugging:** Locate and fix bugs.

### Hints for Success
- Understand the algorithm before coding.
- Start small and test simpler methods first.
- Use print statements and debuggers effectively.

### Defensive Programming
- Write robust programs by checking for exceptional conditions.
- Generate appropriate error messages and handle exceptions.

By following these normalization rules and debugging strategies, one can create well-structured databases and reliable software systems.
My project does not involve databases. 

## Key Takeaways

### Normalization
- **1NF:** Atomic values in each column.
- **2NF:** No partial dependencies on candidate keys.
- **3NF:** No transitive dependencies.
- **BCNF:** Every determinant is a candidate key.
- **4NF:** Eliminate multi-valued dependencies.
- **5NF:** Join dependencies implied by candidate keys.
- **Lossless Decomposition:** No information loss when splitting tables.

### Debugging
- **Process:** Reproduce → Locate → Identify → Fix → Test → Document.
- **Strategies:** Brute Force, Backtracking, Forward Analysis, Cause Elimination, Static/Dynamic Analysis, Collaborative Debugging, Logging, Automated Debugging.
- **Common Errors:** Syntax, Logical, Runtime, Stack Overflow, Infinite Loops, Concurrency Issues.
- **Tools:** IDEs (Visual Studio, Eclipse), Standalone Debuggers (GDB), Logging Utilities, Static/Dynamic Analysis Tools, Performance Profilers.
- **Testing vs Debugging:** Testing finds bugs; debugging fixes them.
- **Defensive Programming:** Handle exceptions and edge cases.

### General Tips
- **Normalization:** Aim for at least 3NF for clean, efficient databases.
- **Debugging:** Start small, use print statements, and leverage debugging tools.

## This week's work

I aimed to understand the overall theorical knowledge needed to understand how to build this project.
The RL concepts needed, libraries commonly used to formulate them, etc. 
I also wanted to gather data from Dubai's most congested highways, like Sheikh Mohammed Road, which I frequent daily, spending over 2 hours one-way.

## Student Tracker Submission
We were told to fill a form regarding how satisfied we were with our progress and how our experiences with our professors have been so far.
I outlined how supportive Ms. Geethu has been and how she gave crucial advice that has lead to a great project, but also about how I'm dissappointed in myself for my delay in finalising my project topic.
I promised to catch up and live up to the expectations of my professors & peers.
