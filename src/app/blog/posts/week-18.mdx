This week, I finally got started on actually building the VSL simulation system using the MetaNet framework (a macroscopic traffic modeling tool). 
It was messy at first — lots of random TypeErrors, missing inputs, and figuring out what’s what — but I’m starting to get a better grasp of how everything connects.

## Goals:
- Create a simulation class to represent a real stretch of highway in my city
- Use MetaNet’s structure (Nodes, Links, Ramps) to define the network
- Try to keep it close to the working example first before making it custom

### What I figured out:
- Network setup starts from Nodes and Links, then adds Origins, Destinations, and Paths. The example script did this really cleanly, so I copied the pattern and adjusted the road segments to match my actual layout.
- MetaNet is super picky about ordering and uniqueness in node names, ramp demands, and route paths. I kept getting duplicate node/path errors until I cleaned things up.
- Each Link has length, number of segments, and type (Link, LinkWithVsl, Ramp), and ramps need their own demands too.

Originally I thought I'd just use the center segment of the road for VSL, but turns out changing speed limits too often on short segments makes no real-world sense — I’ll apply a single VSL across all 3 segments to make it practical.

## How I built the base network:
Here’s the rough flow I followed to define the road network structure using MetaNet:

- Created main highway link (L1) using LinkWithVsl, with:
    - Total length of ~4.5 km
    - Split into 3 segments
    - 4 lanes total

- Added on-ramps (R1, R2, etc.) using the Ramp class, each connected to different points along the main link
- Defined nodes (N0, N1, ...) to serve as junctions between links and ramps

- Connected everything using:
    - add_link(link, up_node, down_node) to define topology
    - add_origin() and add_destination() to specify entry/exit points
    - add_path() to define vehicle routing paths from origin to destination
    - Created a Network instance to wrap all of the above together
    - Verified that each ramp had its own demand model so it injects vehicles properly into the simulation

This structure mirrored a real 3-segment stretch of road I had data for. Initially, I was getting tons of weird errors (like “missing arguments” or “duplicated node”) until I carefully followed the ordering used in the example.

Hiccups:
- I used add_link() in the wrong way for a while before realizing I was missing the arguments.
- The environment wasn't resetting properly because I wasn’t calling reset() or storing states right — fixed that after digging into the example.
- Speed limits were initially not affecting the simulation because I forgot to apply v_limit as part of the input action.

Win of the week:
I finally got a running simulation with a dummy agent applying random VSLs, and the traffic flow & density started reacting to it! Super motivating to see some dynamic behavior on the plots.
