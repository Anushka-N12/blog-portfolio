## Software Protection Methods

Today's session covered the various legal mechanisms available to protect software, including:

1. **Copyrights**
2. **Trade Secrets**  
3. **Patents**
4. **Trademarks**

These protections often overlap and can be used simultaneously to safeguard different aspects of software.

### Copyright Protection Â©

**What it covers:**
- Original works of authorship fixed in tangible form
- Protects the "expression of the idea" not the idea itself
- Includes source code, object code, and screen displays

**Exclusive rights granted:**
- Reproduction
- Creation of derivative works
- Distribution
- Public performance

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't protect procedures, systems, or methods of operation
- Merger Doctrine limits protection when ideas can only be expressed one way
- Requires substantial similarity of protectable expression for infringement

---

### Trade Secrets

**Definition:**  
Information that:
1. Isn't generally known
2. Provides economic advantage  
3. Has reasonable secrecy measures

**Applicable to software:**
- Source/object code
- Design specifications
- Algorithms
- Data structures
- Customer lists

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't protect against reverse engineering
- Independent creation is allowed
- Public disclosure ends protection

### Software Patents

**Key requirements for patentability:**
1. Novelty
2. Inventive step  
3. Industrial application

**Evolution of software patents:**
- **1970s:** Generally not patentable (seen as mathematical algorithms)
- **1980s:** Became patentable as processes if they didn't preempt algorithms
- **1990s:** Required "useful, concrete, tangible result"
- **Today:** No physical transformation required, business methods eligible

### Drafting Software Patents

**Application components:**
1. Title 
2. Background
3. Summary 
4. Description of drawings
5. Detailed description
6. Claims

**Types of drawings:**
1. Hardware/component diagrams
2. Process flowcharts  
3. Functional block diagrams
4. Database tables
5. Graphical displays
6. Source code listings

### Key Takeaways

1. **Layered Protection:** Use multiple legal mechanisms (copyright + patents + trade secrets) for comprehensive coverage
2. **Copyright Limitations:** Protects expression but not underlying ideas or methods
3. **Patent Evolution:** Software patentability has significantly expanded since the 1970s
4. **Global Differences:** Patent protection varies by jurisdiction
5. **Documentation Matters:** Proper patent applications require specific types of technical drawings and descriptions

Understanding these protection methods is crucial for software developers and companies to safeguard their intellectual property investments.
