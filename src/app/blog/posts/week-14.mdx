## The Data Hunt

Beyond the model code and simulation work, I've been wrestling with **data collection** - and it's been taking longer than I expected.
Some endpoints covered a certain distance before & after given coordinates, some only before it, etc. 

### API Endpoint Exploration
- Went through detailed documentation to identify relevant endpoints
- Tested each one extensively
- Had to constantly switch between:
  - Endpoint documentation
  - Format specification pages
  - Google Maps (for coordinate verification)
  - Visualization tools (for making sense of long coordinate lists)

**Unexpected Discovery:**  
The so-called "traffic density service" didn't actually provide density metrics - just details about their road coverage. Not what I needed at all.

## Data Limitations Concerns

### Current Data Reality:
- **Primary Metrics Available:**
  - Speed data
  - Travel time spent (TTS)

### My Worries:
1. TTS is already my evaluation metric, which leaves only **speed data as input**
2. My architecture is relatively complex for such simple input data
3. Concerned about whether this will actually result in a better model

### Silver Linings:
- While the data is simple, it has **significant variance** 
- Planning to enhance with:
  - Speed predictions
  - Incident parameters
- The reference paper succeeded with neural networks on similar data
- My architecture actually **minimizes complexity** by:
  - Using a single feature extractor
  - Branching into different specialized outputs

## Research Reality Check

This process has reminded me what research is really about:
- Trying new approaches
- Working with imperfect information
- Reaching conclusions (whether positive or negative)
- Pushing forward even when things don't match initial expectations

The road ahead might be uncertain, but that's part of the journey.
