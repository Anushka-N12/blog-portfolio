## Model Status Update

Encountered some instability issues:
- Graphs were showing opposite/inconsistent trends
- Model behavior varied between runs
- Later identified the root cause (but results still imperfect)

## Presentation Strategy Advice

Key recommendations from supervisor:
1. **Focus on what works**  
   - Highlight functional components first
   - Demonstrate stable aspects clearly

2. **Address limitations professionally**  
   - "For the unstable elements, here are potential optimization paths..."
   - "Future work could investigate..."
   
3. **Context matters**  
   - This is bachelor's level research
   - The topic is inherently broad/complex
   - Perfect results aren't expected at this stage

## Viva Preparation

Additional guidance:
- Structure presentation to show:
  - Clear problem understanding
  - Methodological rigor
  - Honest assessment of results
- Be ready to discuss:
  - Technical challenges faced
  - Alternative approaches considered
  - Practical implications

**Final Note:**  
The focus should be on demonstrating learning and systematic thinking, not just perfect outcomes.
