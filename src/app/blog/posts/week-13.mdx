The standard deadline passed, and most completed their vivas too this week. 
Since I've thankfully been given the much needed extra time, I wanted to plan out the project again,
so that I can include all the things I wanted to do and deleiver a good product at the end. 

I honestly hit a roadblock. I had written some rough code for the model based on some tutorials, 
and found a source for the data. But what I didn't know at the beginnning of this semester was that
research papers only talk about the concept and theoretical steps justifying it, but seldom about the actual steps of implementation.
I found only one Github repo for the simulation model, but I realised that even if there were more,
there won't be a solution ready for my use-case - a model that takes in the safety parameter I had in mind, or one where I can control the amount of compliance to the speed limit.
How to train my model by linking it to this simulation, making it run there and updating itself based on the resultant TTS.

There were a few sample scripts that came with the METANET package, so I went through those to understand
its current capabilities. It was written by a PhD candidate from the same university as the writer of the main paper, 
so I was hoping to find atleast some similarities. Here's what I picked up from it:
- Defines a traffic network using building blocks - Link, Node, Origin, Destination.
- Sets traffic parameters like max density, free flow speed.
- Creates a demand profile over time (vehicle inflow).
- Runs a simulation loop over time using MetaNet's CasADi backend.
- Records variables like density (rho), speed (v), queue (w).
- Plots results and calculates a performance metric: TTS (Total Time Spent).

I first broke the task down into smaller chunks to tackle it step-by-step:
 - TomTom returns road segment structure around given coordinates, and in METANET we define the structure (to some extent).
 So I'm hoping to pick a road segment that I pass by everyday and know its actual peak times, and try to gather data points from there
 & simulate in the model.
 - I want to compare the basic simulation to real data to compare how similar the model is predicting road behaviour. 
 - Will probably run the API for a while and collect data instead of trying to train in real-time. 
 - Will try simulating an accident indirectly like suddenly reducing average speed. 

 So here's how I'll approach it:

Step 1: Start by replicating this script: Run it exactly as-is to make sure everything works. Understand how the network is created and how the simulation loop works.
Step 2: Replace static demands with live/real data: Replace the create_demands function with real traffic flow data from the API. 
Step 3: Run models together.
Step 4: Add modifications.
Step 5: Use partial network to observe performance in comparison. 

How RL Training should work, for each episode (a full simulation run):
- Reset the MetaNet simulation to its initial state (rho, v, w)
- For each time step:
-- Get the current state from MetaNet (e.g., density, speed, queue length, demand)
-- Feed that state to your agent â†’ it outputs a speed limit (or other action)
-- Apply the action to MetaNet (i.e., set v_ctrl)
-- Step the simulation forward (MetaNet gives you the next state, flow, etc.)
-- Calculate the reward (e.g., based on queue length, speed smoothness, TTS, etc.)
-- Store the transition (state, action, reward, next_state, done) in the replay buffer
-- After a few steps or after the episode ends, sample batches from the replay buffer and:
-- Update the actor and critics

-Repeat over many episodes
