## Project Approval

### What Changed Since Last Time?
- **Thorough Research:** I analyzed several works related to my topic, identifying their **pros and cons**.
- **Combining Positive Aspects:** My plan was to combine the best aspects of existing solutions.
- **Algorithmic Improvements:** I proposed additional **algorithmic changes** inspired by unrelated contexts to further enhance the solution.

### Feedback from Ms. Geethu:
- **Contribution Validated:** She agreed that these changes count as **genuine contributions** and was happy with the approach.
- **Approval Granted:** My project was **officially approved**!

## Technical Considerations

### Computational Requirements:
- **Hardware Needs:** None of the papers I reviewed mentioned special hardware requirements.
- **Training Challenges:** Training AI models is computationally heavy and tends to be slow on normal devices.
- **Ms. Geethu’s Suggestion:** She recommended using **Google Colab** for training, as it offers **GPU acceleration**.
- **My Plan:** I’ll follow this advice since my laptop is already laggy and would struggle with training AI models.

## Next Steps

With the project approved, here’s what I plan to do next:
1. **Data Collection:** Start gathering the necessary data for the project.
2. **Implementation:** Begin the basic steps of implementation.
3. **Local Application:** Apply the project to data from my city and present it to local authorities in competitions.
   - Inspired by last year’s **carpooling solution** that won the **Think Tank competition** from RTA.
