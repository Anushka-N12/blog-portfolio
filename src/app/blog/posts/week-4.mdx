Roshan Sir went over Methodologies today, explaining which is suitable for what type of projects & so on.

The lecture covered various software development methodologies, focusing on their processes, advantages, and disadvantages. 
It began with an overview of generic process models, emphasizing the importance of task sets, process assessment, and improvement. 
Prescriptive process models, such as the Waterfall, Prototyping, Spiral, and Unified Process models, are discussed, 
highlighting their structured approaches and suitability for different project types. 
Each model has its pros and cons, such as the Waterfall model's simplicity but lack of flexibility, and the Spiral model's risk management but complexity.
The lecture then shifted to Agile methodologies, which prioritize rapid, adaptive responses to change, continuous customer involvement, and iterative software delivery. 
Key Agile principles include customer satisfaction through frequent software increments, motivated teams, and sustainable work practices. 
Specific Agile frameworks like Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), and Kanban were detailed, outlining their processes, benefits, and challenges. 
For instance, Scrum emphasizes lightweight documentation and frequent updates, while XP focuses on customer involvement and high developer commitment.
DevOps is introduced as a methodology that integrates development and operations, emphasizing continuous development, testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring. 
It offers benefits like reduced deployment time and proactive monitoring but requires expert teams and effective automated tools.
The lecture also discussed adapting process models to fit specific projects and teams, emphasizing the importance of stakeholder involvement, iterative development, and risk management. 
It concluded with guidelines for prototype design, evaluation, and maintenance, stressing the need for continuous testing, stakeholder feedback, and documentation to ensure software quality and adaptability. 
Overall, the content provided a comprehensive overview of various software development methodologies, their applications, and best practices for successful project execution.
