## This Week's Work

Since my previous idea had repetitive features (e.g., note-taking), I resumed my search for a fresh idea. Here’s what I explored:

---

### Exploring Medical Applications of Computer Vision
- **Why Not Medical Applications?**
  - While impactful, I felt I didn’t have much to add to existing solutions.
  - Most publicly available datasets already have advanced solutions beyond my current skill level.
- **Papers Reviewed:**
  - Diseases like **Alzheimer’s**, **cancers**, and **Parkinson’s**.
  - Found that many advanced models and solutions already exist for these areas.

### Next Steps
- Continue searching for a unique and impactful idea.
- Focus on areas where I can add value and innovate.
- Discuss potential ideas with my supervisor for feedback.
