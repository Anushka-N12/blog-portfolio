## Project Status Update

Gave a straightforward progress report:
- **Completed:** Model development and simulation scripts
- **Pending:** Final evaluation and testing

## Addressing Concerns

Had an honest discussion about code volume:
- Expressed my worry about lines-of-code appearing deceptively small
- She reassured me that with TensorFlow, most complexity happens under the hood
- What matters is understanding the framework's inner workings

## Future Enhancements

Shared two potential additions:
1. **Web Demo Concept**
   - Simple Google Maps integration to visualize model outputs
   - Received positive feedback on this idea

2. **Driver Acceptance Survey**
   - Prepared questionnaire about VSL (Variable Speed Limits) acceptance
   - Feedback: Not essential but could strengthen conclusions
   - Can include if time permits (even just a few responses)

## Report Review

Showed my current draft report:
- Received helpful structural suggestions
- Will reorganize content based on feedback

## Moving Forward

Focus areas before deadline:
1. Complete evaluation phase
2. Consider implementing web visualization
3. Potentially distribute survey
4. Restructure report as advised
