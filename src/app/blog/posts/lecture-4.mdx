## Methodologies in Software Development

This week, **Roshan Sir** covered various **software development methodologies**, explaining their processes, advantages, and disadvantages. Here’s a breakdown of the key points:

---

### Generic Process Models
- **Task Sets, Process Assessment, and Improvement:** Emphasized the importance of these elements in software development.
- **Prescriptive Process Models:**
  - **Waterfall Model:** Simple and structured but lacks flexibility.
  - **Prototyping Model:** Focuses on building prototypes for feedback.
  - **Spiral Model:** Emphasizes risk management but can be complex.
  - **Unified Process Model:** Iterative and incremental approach.

---

### Agile Methodologies
- **Core Principles:**
  - Rapid, adaptive responses to change.
  - Continuous customer involvement.
  - Iterative software delivery.
- **Key Agile Frameworks:**
  - **Scrum:** Lightweight documentation and frequent updates.
  - **Extreme Programming (XP):** High customer involvement and developer commitment.
  - **Kanban:** Visual workflow management for continuous delivery.

---

### DevOps
- **Integration of Development and Operations:**
  - Continuous development, testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduced deployment time.
  - Proactive monitoring.
- **Challenges:**
  - Requires expert teams.
  - Needs effective automated tools.
