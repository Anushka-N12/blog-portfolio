Welcome back to the VSL project dev blog! This post covers the early days of getting the model up and running â€” when nothing worked, shapes yelled at me, and reward curves were flatter than a desert highway. ðŸ˜…
This week, the main goal was to plug the SAC model & the simulation environment together & start training. 

## First Errors: Shape Mismatches Everywhere
- CasADi states had different shapes from TensorFlow tensors
- Actions were being passed in as scalars when the model expected vectors
- Rewards didnâ€™t make sense (turns out they werenâ€™t being scaled properly)
- Even my state construction (e.g., flattening segment speeds, VSLs) had misalignments

A lot of the fixes came down to:

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact={false}
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: `np.array(...).flatten()
tf.convert_to_tensor(...)
reshape(-1, 1)`,
            label: 'train.py',
            language: 'python',
            showLineNumbers: true
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
    maxHeight="400px"
/>
...and a lot of print-debugging!

## The Flat Reward Curve
Once things ran, I hit another issue: the reward curve was basically a flat line. Agent wasnâ€™t learning anything. A few potential causes:
- Too sparse or noisy rewards (only small changes every step)
- Too short episode length
- Wrong scaling (I was giving raw -TTS as reward instead of -tanh() or 1/tts)
- Actions not affecting the sim enough â€” like setting VSLs but traffic wasnâ€™t reacting much

To begin with, I played around with the scaling. The values did change, NaN errors stopped, but there's alot more to go.
There is still alot I need to wrap my head around when it comes to RL systems. There is so much content I haven't gone through yet, 
looking forwardto learn about it as I tried things to fix this. 

## Pending:
- Tune hyperparameters based on initial runs
- Add logging and visualization to monitor performance
