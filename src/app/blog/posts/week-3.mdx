We did not have our lecture about literature reviews today, due to the AI Everything event taking place at the same time at Expo City.
The whole class was told to work on it this week, and we were allowed to attend the event due to its relevance to our tech careers. 

## This week's work

Here is the first proposal I sent my professor - [ThriveAI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PX519lp7aPpOymuXiDA5DYkqTzeBFzqH/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100640676487683067455&rtpof=true&sd=true).
It is a personal assistant. It is meant to wrap around an LLM API like ChatGPT or Deepseek, but with additonal mechanisms that differentiate the user experience.

With generic LLMs, you must give it context in every conversation separately for it to respond accordingly. All its outputs are in a chat format that you have to manually organize into a document if required. 
It is also problematic to make it process large audio files without limitations or subcriptions etc. You must always initiate the conversation, and tell it what to do.

My idea with ThriveAI was focused on prodcutivity, combined with mental health:
* Other than the chat interface page, I wanted an digital diary page which is updated by the bot as we talk about topics each day, like keeping track of daily activities in a diary.
* I also wanted a goals page, where I can see pending tasks and have them broken down into actionable points.
* Within the chat interface, I wanted a mic option which can be switched on for long amounts of time, to be able to record meetings, lectures, basically any conversation that you would like it to track.
Breaking that audio down to minutes of the meeting, notes and action points to follow up on would be of significant help.
* I wanted to integrate it with Google calendar, where it can schedule my tasks for me and send reminders.
* Other than work, I also wanted it to have a mental-health expert in the loop, which I had built a few months prior. 
* I also wanted the reminders to include small positive habits thorughout the day.
