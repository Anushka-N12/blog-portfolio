## Lecture

This week, our lecture on **literature reviews** was canceled due to the **AI Everything event** at Expo City. The event was highly relevant to our tech careers, so the class was encouraged to attend. Instead of the lecture, we were tasked with working on our literature reviews and proposals.

### First Proposal Submission

I submitted my first proposal, titled **ThriveAI**, to my professor. Here’s an overview of the idea:

#### What is ThriveAI?
ThriveAI is a **personal assistant** built around an LLM API (like ChatGPT or Deepseek) but with additional mechanisms to enhance the user experience. Unlike generic LLMs, ThriveAI aims to provide a more seamless, context-aware, and productivity-focused interaction.

#### Problems with Generic LLMs:
- **Lack of Context:** Users must provide context in every conversation.
- **Chat-Only Outputs:** Responses are in chat format, requiring manual organization into documents if needed.
- **Audio Processing Limitations:** Large audio files are difficult to process without subscriptions or limitations.
- **User-Initiated Conversations:** The user must always initiate and direct the conversation.

#### Key Features of ThriveAI:
1. **Digital Diary:**
   - A dedicated page for a digital diary, updated by the bot based on daily conversations.
   - Tracks daily activities and organizes them into a structured format.

2. **Goals Page:**
   - Displays pending tasks and breaks them down into actionable points.
   - Helps users stay organized and focused on their goals.

3. **Audio Integration:**
   - A mic option for long-duration audio recording (e.g., meetings, lectures).
   - Automatically breaks down audio into meeting minutes, notes, and action points.

4. **Calendar Integration:**
   - Integrates with **Google Calendar** to schedule tasks and send reminders.
   - Automates task management and time planning.

5. **Mental Health Support:**
   - Includes a **mental health expert** module (built previously) to provide emotional support.
   - Sends reminders for small, positive habits throughout the day to promote mental well-being.

### Why ThriveAI?
ThriveAI is designed to address the limitations of current LLMs by:
- **Reducing Manual Effort:** Automates context retention, task breakdown, and scheduling.
- **Enhancing Productivity:** Combines task management, note-taking, and goal tracking in one platform.
- **Promoting Mental Health:** Integrates mental health support and positive habit reminders.
