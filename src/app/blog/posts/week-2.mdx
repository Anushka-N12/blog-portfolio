We discussed research ethics, ensuring that all projects adhere to ethical standards, particularly when involving human participants or sensitive data. 
We reviewed the required documents that we need to submit, regarding ethical considerations in relation to our project proposal. 
We all need to complete a Research Ethics Screening Form and submit it to their supervisor - who then decides if an ethical review is needed. If not, the student can proceed with the research, and an approved checklist is included in the final submission.If an ethical review is required, the student completes the ethics application form with supporting documents and submits it to the supervisor. This may be passed on for peer review or even the committee. 
We also discussed research methods, and tried to identify the type each student's project might require. 
In the lab session, we worked on finishing our blog pages.
