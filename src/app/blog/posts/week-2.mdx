### Research Methods in Computer Science

We also explored various research methodologies used in Computer Science. Here are the main categories:

1. **Build:**
   - Involves creating an artifact (physical or software) to demonstrate feasibility.
   - Must include new features or innovations.

2. **Experimental:**
   - Used to evaluate new solutions for problems.
   - **Exploratory Phase:** Identify questions about the system.
   - **Evaluation Phase:** Answer those questions through experiments.
   - Results are presented numerically (tables, graphs) with analytical discussion.

3. **Formal/Theoretical:**
   - Focuses on proving facts about algorithms and systems.
   - Often involves mathematical modeling and abstraction.
   - Examples: Computational geometry, parallel and distributed computing.

4. **Process:**
   - Studies the processes used to accomplish tasks in computing.
   - Common in Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction.
   - Examples: Design and evaluation of interactive systems, cognitive processes in AI.

5. **Model/Simulate:**
   - Defines an abstract model of a real system to understand it better.
   - Models are simpler than the actual system.
   - Simulations and model checking are used to verify functionality.

6. **Exploratory Research:**
   - **Quantitative Research:**
     - Develops models, theories, and hypotheses.
     - Involves measuring phenomena.
     - Requires large samples and repeatable experiments.
   - **Qualitative Research:**
     - Involves fieldwork, interviews, and observations.
     - Typically uses small sample sizes.
     - Experiments are not necessarily repeatable.

### Methodological Research Cycle

Key questions to ask during the research process:
- **What do you want to achieve?**
- **Where does the data come from?** Possible sources: Reading, observation, enquiry, measurement, experiment, modeling.
- **How to collect data?** Field, lab, or conceptual approaches.
- **What will you do with the data?** Draw conclusions, identify patterns, evaluate results, calculate numbers, establish principles.

---

### Generic Methodological Research Process
1. Review the literature.
2. Define the research problem.
3. Formulate research questions/hypotheses.
4. Design the research.
5. Collect and analyze data.
6. Interpret results.
7. Report findings.
8. Feedback and feedforward for continuous improvement.

---

### Challenges of Research
- **Logistical Challenges:** Timeframe, access to information, cost of research.
- **Content Challenges:** Necessary knowledge, finding relevant literature, analyzing data.

---

### Research Question Checklist
- Is the question well-defined and doable?
- Are the terms clear and assumptions checked?
- Can you gather the necessary information within the timeframe?
- Do you have the skills and resources to answer the question?
- Are there any ethical concerns?

---

### Lab Session
- In the lab, we worked on finalizing our blog design.

## Summary

This week’s discussions were crucial in understanding the **ethical considerations** and **research methodologies** for our projects. Key takeaways:
- **Ethics Approval:** Complete the Research Ethics Screening Form and follow the approval process.
- **Research Methods:** Choose the appropriate methodology based on the project’s goals.
- **Next Steps:** Finalize the blog design and submit the ethics form based on the data needed for the project.

---

## Key Takeaways
- **Ethics First:** Ensure all projects adhere to ethical standards, especially when involving human participants or sensitive data.
- **Research Methodologies:** Choose the right approach (e.g., Build, Experimental, Formal/Theoretical) based on the project’s goals.
- **Research Process:** Follow the methodological research cycle to ensure a structured and effective project.
- **Blog Design:** Finalize the blog design and post updates regularly.

---

This week was all about laying the groundwork for ethical and methodologically sound research. Looking forward to finalizing the blog and moving forward with the project!

## This Week's Work

I went through lots of ideas from many sources but struggled to find the right balance in terms of **difficulty level**, **innovation**, and **impact**. I didn’t want to redo what someone else has done, but I wasn’t coming up with original, impactful ideas. I realized I needed to change my approach but wasn’t sure how.

### Current Approach:
- **Exploring Thesis Databases:** I’m checking thesis databases from universities around the world for inspiration.
- **Keyword Searches:** Using Google, Google Scholar, and YouTube to look up relevant keywords and topics.
- **Referencing Papers & Datasets:** I’ve compiled a list of papers, datasets, and resources to explore further.

## Next Steps

- **Continue Exploring Ideas:** I’ll keep searching for a unique and impactful project idea.
- **Refine Approach:** I need to rethink my strategy for finding inspiration and narrowing down ideas.
- **Discuss with Supervisor:** I’ll share my progress and challenges with Ms. Geethu to get further guidance.
