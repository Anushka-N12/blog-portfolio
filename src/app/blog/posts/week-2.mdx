We discussed research ethics, ensuring that all projects adhere to ethical standards, particularly when involving human participants or sensitive data. 
We reviewed the required documents that we need to submit, regarding ethical considerations in relation to our project proposal. 
We all need to complete a Research Ethics Screening Form and submit it to their supervisor - who then decides if an ethical review is needed. If not, the student can proceed with the research, and an approved checklist is included in the final submission.If an ethical review is required, the student completes the ethics application form with supporting documents and submits it to the supervisor. This may be passed on for peer review or even the committee. 

We also discussed research methods, and tried to identify the type each student's project might require. 

Several methodologies are used to tackle research questions in Computer Science, categorized as:

1. Build: Involves creating an artifact (physical or software) to demonstrate feasibility. Must include new features or innovations.

2. Experimental: Used to evaluate new solutions for problems.

Exploratory phase - Identify questions about the system.
Evaluation phase - Answer those questions through experiments.
Results are presented numerically (tables, graphs) with analytical discussion.

3. Formal/Theoretical: Focuses on proving facts about algorithms and systems. Often involves mathematical modeling and abstraction.
Examples - Computational geometry, parallel and distributed computing.

4. Process: Studies the processes used to accomplish tasks in computing. Common in Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction.
Examples - Design and evaluation of interactive systems, cognitive processes in AI.

5. Model/Simulate: Defines an abstract model of a real system to understand it better. Models are simpler than the actual system. Simulations and model checking are used to verify functionality.

6. Exploratory Research: Quantitative vs. Qualitative
Quantitative Research -
Develops models, theories, and hypotheses.
Involves measuring phenomena.
Requires large samples and repeatable experiments.

Qualitative Research -
Involves fieldwork, interviews, and observations.
Typically uses small sample sizes.
Experiments are not necessarily repeatable.

Questions to ask in the Methodological Research Cycle:
What do you want to achieve?
Where does the data come from? Possible Sources: Reading, observation, enquiry, measurement, experiment, modeling.
How to collect data? Could be Field, lab, or conceptual approaches.
What will you do with the data? Draw conclusions, identify patterns, evaluate results, calculate numbers, establish principles.

Generic Methodological Research Process:
Review the literature.
Define the research problem.
Formulate research questions/hypotheses.
Design the research.
Collect and analyze data.
Interpret results.
Report findings.
Feedback and feedforward for continuous improvement.

Challenges of Research:
Logistical - Timeframe, access to information, cost of research.
Content - Necessary knowledge, finding relevant literature, analyzing data.

Research Question Checklist:
Is the question well-defined and doable?
Are the terms clear and assumptions checked?
Can you gather the necessary information within the timeframe?
Do you have the skills and resources to answer the question?
Are there any ethical concerns?

In the lab session, we worked on finishing our blog pages. 

## Refining the Idea

details to be added

## Summary

We must finish & post our blog soon, and fill the research ethics form based on data needed for our project.
