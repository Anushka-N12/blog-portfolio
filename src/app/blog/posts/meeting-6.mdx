## Deferral
The standard deadline was April 11th, that is a few days away. But the project progress was not going how it should be.
I had personal reasons for this, but I waited this far to try and catch up. But last week the possibility of a deferral occured to me, and I spoke to the module & CEI department head Dr. Fehmida about it the next day since I was on campus & found her.
She has been aware of my situation, and had approved my gap year 2 years ago as well for the same reasons. I explained the current circumstances. 
She was very understanding, and advised me to go ahead and apply for a defferal. I submitted the application the next day.

I discussed it with my supervisor today. She reassured me that she believes in my abilities and that I wouldn't let this happen just out of neglect. I am very thankful to her for understanding. 
She let me know that although the general email said the submissions need to be done by July, the evaluation might need to be done earlier, and that I should keep an earlier date in mind for safety. 
She will confirm the exact deadline later, after they recieve the list of deferrals and decide accordingly. 

Next, I discussed my project with her. I first asked her about the idea itself. Since Ihad been given more time, I wanted to finalise the decision of whether the current one is good enough for this module's requirements & for good marks. She reassured me that it is indeed good and I should continue working on this.
I had explained the basic idea during the approval, but gained much more clarity while writing the research proposal for a competition.
She said she reviewed the document, and the topic and approach is good, and can even potentially be turned into a paper. She said it had a good chance of being accepted into the competition. 
I explained details like the algorithm & data formats too. I had a concern about whether the algorithm I want to try will actually perform better, since the data formats in referred papers were different and the experiment I want to do with the data I'm using hasnt been shown before. 
She advised me to go ahead with the tests, and that I can submit the best performing as the project, and can write the comparison aspects for the paper. 

I am deeply grateful to my supervisor for supporting me at every step. I delayed the idea itself, the progress, took a deferral, had doubts with the idea, and whether the hypothesis will actually be met.
She did not pressurize me about the timings, understood the issues I'm facing, told me what to do in both situations, and is my strength pushing me to continue.
