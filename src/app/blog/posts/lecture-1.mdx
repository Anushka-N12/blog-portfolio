## Introduction to the Module

This week marked the beginning of the **Major Project and Professional Practice (PDE3823)** module. This 60-credit module is designed to synthesize our prior learning and shape our professional trajectory through a major project. Over the next 12 weeks, we will:
- Work under the guidance of an assigned supervisor.
- Develop a project based on our chosen discipline and career aspirations.
- Focus on **research, planning, management, and communication**.
- Deliver a professionally presented project portfolio, which includes:
  - A **technical report** (60% of the grade).
  - A **presentation** (25% of the grade).
  - A **technical blog** (15% of the grade) documenting progress.

The module is led by **Dr. Fehmida Hussain** and supported by **Mr. Roshan Renji**. We were advised to meet weekly with our supervisors to ensure steady progress.
