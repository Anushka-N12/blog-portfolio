I proposed another idea to my supervisor Ms. Geethu, regarding a wildlife species monitoring system involving computer vision. 
She asked similar questions I should expect during the viva when I present the idea, making me understand how I need to prepare for that.
My project involved an FPGA implementation, that I hadn't done before, so she asked me to do a bit more reasearch and be clear about how I will be able to achieve that.

## Following Research

Upon checking the hardware related papers as my supervisor adviced, I realized that based on the characteristics of the 
FPGA board available in our labs at university, I will not be able to demonstrate the implementation effiiently. So I resumed my 
search for a more suitable idea.
