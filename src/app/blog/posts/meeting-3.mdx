## Introduction

In this meeting, I proposed another idea to my supervisor, **Ms. Geethu**. The idea involved a **wildlife species monitoring system** using **computer vision**. She asked me several questions to help me prepare for the viva and understand the depth of research required for the project.

## Feedback and Questions

Ms. Geethu’s questions focused on:
1. **Why This Topic?** She asked about the motivation behind choosing this project.
2. **Implementation Plan:** She wanted clarity on how I planned to implement the system, especially the **FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)** component, which I hadn’t worked with before.
3. **Preparation for Viva:** Her questions mirrored what I might face during the viva, helping me understand how to prepare for it.

## Following Research

After the meeting, I conducted further research on the **FPGA implementation** as advised by Ms. Geethu. Here’s what I discovered:
- **Hardware Limitations:** Based on the characteristics of the FPGA board available in our university labs, I realized that I wouldn’t be able to demonstrate the implementation efficiently.
- **Next Steps:** I decided to resume my search for a **more suitable idea** that aligns better with the available resources and my skill set.
